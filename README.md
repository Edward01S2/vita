# Grunt Automation

Grunt is used to create a package file (for Themeforest Upload).

First, install the grunt CLI:

```
#!cmd

npm install -g grunt-cli
```

Then in your project root, install grunt and related plugins:

```
#!cmd

npm install
```

You can then run the build function with grunt:


```
#!cmd

grunt build
```
